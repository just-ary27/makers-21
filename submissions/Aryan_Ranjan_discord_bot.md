Future plans::
1.Add support for **Spotify** via Spotify Api through tekore.py
2.Add **rank system** like MEE 6 bot.(will use databases for that)
3.**More** moderation commands.
4.Use AI libraries to extend the chat feature so that the bot can learn as it's trained.
5.Make the bot **able to do solve math problems** also!

Made by referring to::
1.**discord.py** Documentation Release 0.16.12.
2.**youtube_dl** library for handling the Music bot part.
3.Using the pyCharm IDE as it is better for handling python packages
4.Python version 3.9.0
